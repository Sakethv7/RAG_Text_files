Children throw tantrums when they are overwhelmed by strong emotions, overstimulated, or anxious. Young children may have tantrums because of strong emotions, while older children may have tantrums because they don't know how to express or manage their feelings.

Overstimulation can also cause tantrums, as children don't always recognize when bright lights or loud noises are bothering them. Anxiety can also cause tantrums, such as when a child feels anxious due to an unexpected event, unrealistic demand, or lack of routine.

Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. They can have a meltdown because they can't have something they want like a toy or candy or can't get someone to do what they want like getting a parent to pay attention to them immediately.
